%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

WN_CONNECT is a software application prototype that aims to access the lexical database WordNet. One of its main features is that it has been fully implemented using PROLOG or related technologies.


%% RELEASE NOTES %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

With respect to former version 1.3, the present version 1.4 adds the following:

1) The incorporation of a module (wn_entailments) to deal with entailment relation between verbs. This is a really preliminary attempt.

2) Enhancements in  the module wn_gen_prox_equations in order to allow the generation of proximity equations between "word terms".

Changes:
Eliminated the verbose behaviour of predicates in module wn_ic_measures, because it produces execution errors in the context of certain Bousi~Prolog programs.
