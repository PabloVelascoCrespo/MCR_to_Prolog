%%% ONLY FOR THE EXPERIMENTS (remove comment in the exportation list)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% As part of an investigation into “the relationship between similarity of context and
%%% similarity of meaning (synonymy)”, Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) obtained “synonymy
%%% judgements” from 51 human subjects on 65 pairs of words. The pairs ranged from “highly
%%% synonymous” to “semantically unrelated”, and the subjects were asked to rate them, on
%%% the scale of 0.0 to 4.0, according to their “similarity of meaning”.
%%%
%%% We want to test our YARM measure againts a subset of 20 of these pairs of words, in order
%%% to investigate how well the YARM measure reflects human judgments of semantic relatedness.
%%%
%%% In the experiments we obtained relatedness scores for the human-rated pairs.
%%% Where either or both of the words had more than one synset in WordNet, we took the
%%% most-related pair of synsets.
