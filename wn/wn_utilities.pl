% Use:

%
% Examples:
%   ?- findall(arc(X,Y),(wn_hypernyms(man,List),append(_,[X,Y|_],List)),Graph), wn_display_graph(Graph).

% Requires:
% - PDF displayer (as indicated in pdf_displayer/1 fact and accesible in the path).

% - dot2tex (for generating a LaTeX version of the graph). If LaTeX output is enabled (disabled by default)
